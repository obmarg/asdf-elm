# asdf-elm

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) plugin for [asdf](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf)
version manager.

This is an incredibly simple plugin that leverages npm & asdf itself for most
of the hard work.

## Install

```
asdf plugin-add elm https://github.com/obmarg/asdf-elm.git
```

## Use

Check [asdf](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) readme for instructions on how
to install & manage versions of Elm.

Installing Elm requires npm - you can use
[asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf-nodejs) to install this if you
don't have it already.  Note that you need `.tool-versions` file with nodejs in it 
in your home directory for the install to work.
